# Robust-Control-of-a-Inverted-Pendulum
Here as a part of an acedemic project, many controllers like the PID, Fuzzy Logic and the Robust along with Fuzzy Logic controllers were created and simulated in MATLAB
To run the simulation First Extract all the components of the zip file
To see the simulation of the PID controller, look at the PID.m code and run it in MATLAB to see the output of the controller
To see the simulation of the Fuzzy Logic Controller, open the Fuzzy_controller.slx simulink model and run the simulation in simulink to see the controller stabalize the pendulum at an angle very close to the vertical.
To see the simulation of the Robust Fuzzy Logic Controller, open the Robust_Fuzzy_controller.slx simulink model and run the simulation in simulink to see the controller stabalize the pendulum at an angle very close to the vertical.
A report is created mentioning in great detail how these simulations were designed and comparing the performance of each controller
